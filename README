------------------------------------
            PURPOSE:
------------------------------------
    This program can get video from some web page is you can use the right configuration for it (if you can find it).
    I mostly wrote this program for my personnal use and to try golang programming, so you can see it as a POC project.

    If what you need is not a video, but only an audio file from it, there is an option to get it.
    But it will need to have some libs install as it just use an already existing program to do so:
        see https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Synopsis


------------------------------------
            How it works:
------------------------------------
    Using the configuration, the program will fetch some URL, parse the content in order to find the video URL we want can get the video from
    The parsing is fixed to some web site and all information about the parsings elements are inside the configuration file.
    All the parsing informations are loaded in a structure containing all possible parser.

    Each parser then contains its all logical call and it used according to the parser type you asked for.
    Obviously using a wrong parser type on an URL will fail.

    If the program fails for whatever reason you can get some information about the reasons by turning the logger into "DebugLevel"
    using the option log-lvl

    If you need more information the --help option should help you :).

------------------------------------
            Testing
------------------------------------
The test are launch using docker (so you should have install it before), Using
    $ make test

You can launch the test on you desktop but they should fail if you are not using a "Unix like" system.
(because the test use path from this system, this is why it is better to run them into a docker)
